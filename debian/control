Description: core etcetera files for the Grml system
 This package includes some /etc files for the
 Grml system. Whereas the main grml-etc package is
 meant for use on Grml systems this package can be
 used on plain Debian (stable/testing/unstable)
 systems as well.
 This package also includes cpu-screen and ip-screen,
 as they are used by the included screen configuration.
